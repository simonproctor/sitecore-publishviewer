sitecore-publishviewer
======================

Sitecore publish viewer using the SPEAK UI interface. This is currently targeted at the latest version of 
Sitecore (7.5) but it should be possible to backport to an older version of SPEAK if you aren't using that
platform yet.

The code is based on the existing PublishViewer on the Sitecore marketplace which is a Xaml control. This has been
updated to use SPEAK, remove some recursion and also put it on GitHub so it can be conributed to by other developers.

The license is set to LGPL so you can use it in ANY commercial project but if you make any amends to it, you must
share them with the remaining Sitecore community. So we all benefit.
